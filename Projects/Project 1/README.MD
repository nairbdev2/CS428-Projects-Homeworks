## Note
The reason why we had the models in .unitypackage is that github has a file size upload limitation.

## Pre-Requisites
* Android SDK module
* iOS module

## How to Setup the Project
* First create a blank 3D template Unity Project 
* Go to 'Window' Tab in the unity project and click on 'Package Manager'
* Install the Vuforia Engine AR package
* Drag the following folders into the Unity Assets folder:
  * Audio, Materials, Scenes, scripts
* Create a folder in the Unity Project called 'Models'
* Go back to Unity and click on the 'Assets' then 'Import Package' then 'Custom Package' then select a file with .unitypackage
* Repeat the above step for ALL models in the model folder in '\CS428-Projects-Homeworks\Projects\Project 1\'
